			<h1> The solutions for the problems </h1>
			<p>
				Right now, there are many important problems in the world. Here are some possible ways to diminish poverty.
			</p>
			<p>
				- People do not have access to food and / or medical care. <br>
				To solve this problem: <br>
				- The UN or any other organisation should provide people in need medical help, resources such as food, building materials. <br>
				- People don't have stable jobs to provide them with money for a normal life. <br>
				- We should make it our goal to educate all the people in developing countries to help them find stable jobs and decrease the amount of unemployement.
			</p>
			<h3> This is only one of the possible solutions for the problem. <a href=""> Here is the link to the UN's plans for the year 2022 </a>
